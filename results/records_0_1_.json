Additionally, we can see that the buildings located at x = 24 and y = 99, and x = 81 and y = 76 appear to be in close proximity, possibly indicating encirclement.\nTask 3: CAP1: \"Several buildings appear clustered in the top right of the image, while others are dispersed throughout.\" CAP2: \"Some buildings are situated in close proximity, possibly indicating encirclement, while others are more spread out.\"",

The building in the center towards the bottom of the image is surrounded by other buildings.\nTask 2: From the description given, we can identify some high-level spatial patterns.

There are also two clusters of buildings, one at the top left and another at the bottom left. The buildings are dispersed randomly across the image, however, the larger buildings are spaced out in such a way that they don't overlap with any other buildings. There is also interposition happening where some buildings can be seen partially behind others.\nTask 3: CAP 1: A cluster of buildings can be found towards the top and another towards the bottom left of the image, both quite distant from each other.
