        "Task 1:\nThe building located at x = 87 and y = 169 is south of the building located at x = 11 and y = 155.\nThe building located at x = 167 and y = 31 is northeast of the building located at x = 20 and y = 91.\nThe building located at x = 189 and y = 247 is southeast of the building located at x = 191 and y = 72.\nThe car is located northwest of the building located at x = 87 and y = 169.\nTask 2:\nThe buildings are clustered in three areas: bottom left, top right, and bottom right.\nThe building at x = 191 and y = 72 is surrounded by other buildings.\nThe building at x = 233 and y = 235 is isolated from the other buildings.\nThe car is positioned outside of the main building clusters.\nTask 3:\nCAP1: Buildings in three different clusters: bottom left, top right, and bottom right.\nCAP2: Buildings clustered in multiple areas with an isolated building in the bottom right.\nCAP3: Cluster of buildings in the bottom left with two buildings in the top right and bottom right corners.",
        "Certainly, here are new captions that fit the token limit:\nCAP 1: Buildings of varying size dispersed, with encirclement by third and fourth buildings.\nCAP 2: Small car and two buildings clustered, with dispersed other buildings in different directions.\nCAP 3: Image shows varied sized buildings, with fifth interposed and third/fourth encircling."
